# PROJECT NAME : Permission-Aware Deployment Automation Platform

# OBJECTIVE
Build a central automation system that safely manages
multiple GitHub repositories and allows
branch creation, merging, and deployment
only if the user has permission.

# WHY ??
    => Solves a real industry pain
            -- Unsafe deployments
            -- Manual Git operations
            -- No permission control
            -- DevOps bottlenecks

    => MULTIPLE SKILLS at once (🔥)
